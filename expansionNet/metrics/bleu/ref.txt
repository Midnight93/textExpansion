<seg id="1"> so much smaller and easier to transport than the charger that came with the camera system . even comes with a cigarette lighter adapter for car charging ! how thoughtful are the people at wasabi ? </seg>
<seg id="1"> what can i say ... it just works . used it on the dell m4400 display port to hdtv hdmi and voila big screen movie watching . sound need to be connected using 3.5mm jack out of the laptop to sound bar or tv otherwise sound will come out of the laptop . </seg>
<seg id="1"> the high quality of the 15 ' optical digital audio cable from mediabridge products exceeds others i have previously purchased . in particular , it worked perfectly for my application being smaller in diameter and solid black . </seg>
<seg id="1"> bought two units to connect a directv h25 component video cable rgb with rca and an additional 12ft and 25ft component cable to mirror two directv clients to other rooms . i highly recommend this item . </seg>
<seg id="1"> what 's more to say ? plugged it into my linux machine and it instantly configured and started using it . too bad i have to un plug and plug it in to get it working after restoring from linux hibernate . not sure if that is a device or linux deficiency . </seg>
<seg id="1"> i bought this mouse for my granddaughter who has a preference for pink and black and she was thrilled . it works well for what she needs a mouse for . </seg>
<seg id="1"> creative has some creative copy . the products always sound great but inevitably fall short in the experience . for some reason i stii will but their stuff and still wind up feeling disappointed . </seg>
<seg id="1"> looks good . sturdy . if t were n't for the collateral assembly materials , i would have been as lost as a goose in tall grass . the product comes with step-by-step paper instruction . there 's a dvd . seriously . we also found assembly instructions on youtube . we used youtube ... play pause play pause ... ... the only negative is that two thumb screws did n't fit as they should have . remedy : larger pliars and patience . </seg>
<seg id="1"> my phenom x4 system with vista premium 64 bit hates this card . you would think i was running it on a pentium ii with 640k the way it stutters and stops . tried media center with pinnacle driver and no matter what it would not find the tuner . i suspect it runs fine on 32 bit vista . did a good job of finding the qam 's but impossible to watch . swapped it for a hauppauge 1250 board and much happier . </seg>
<seg id="1"> i purchased this camera hoping to save some time getting photos downloaded off the camera . did not work well . if you are planning on using the wifi link to download all your shots , it will take a long time and sometimes fail during the process . much easier to take out the sd card and plug it into your computer card reader . the occasional posting to a social website is probably the limit for wifi functionality . pic quality are only ok. i would not recommend </seg>
<seg id="1"> i use these for travel . many hotel rooms do n't have enough free electrical outlets in convenient places for all the electronic devices we take when we travel . i also use these by my nightstand to charge my iphone and kindle . </seg>
<seg id="1"> i would buy the again , priced right , works real well , no problems , i like it , easy to use cover keeps it clean in pocket </seg>
<seg id="1"> my wife had some trouble getting it to work ( and she has a doctorate ) , it works now . picture quality is fair , we got it on sale , so it was worth the price . </seg>
<seg id="1"> perfect solution . useable and used . i use it almost every day . it is reliable and designed well . perfect for home and business </seg>
<seg id="1"> master bedroom bathroom was a bit & # 34 ; dank/damp & # 34 ; .high humidity and the vent fan was never & # 34 ; enough & # 34 ; . plugged this little ionic freshener in an whammo ! bathroom is fresher now . not sure what the unit actually does - but it works . no noise . appears to be low-power . almost like magic ! happy ! jdmc </seg>
<seg id="1"> i was pleasantly surprised . this thing is sturdy & heavy duty . i was n't sure how it worked , but you charge it up ( which takes a bit ) & then pop your tablet in . all you do it set it up where the magnet holds it in place & that turns it on . simple enough . easy to type on , no problems . i also like that you can charge your tablet with this closed . its also a sturdy heavy cover for your tablet . definitely a thumbs up from me . </seg>
<seg id="1"> what can i say about an apple product that has n't been said already ? i bought this for my grandson for christmas , and he loves it ! </seg>
<seg id="1"> the coiled cord is way too short . i bought this for long exposure shots to keep from shaking the camera when triggering the shutter with the on camera button . the cord is just too short when coiled and if you extend it , it keeps tension on the cord defeating the purpose since it shakes the camera . the coiled cord looks nice but it would be much more funcitonal with a straight one . </seg>
<seg id="1"> i never thought speaker wire matters so much . but , when i replased wire of the same gauge with this wire . my speakers ( bic aquestech 89 ll ) really came alive . the horns are much more crisp . </seg>
<seg id="1"> as with anything sony , buyer regret is sure . the noise canceling only makes things worse even next to a plane turbine . totally worthless . and the sound quality is on par than my in-ears that came with my mobile . </seg>
<seg id="1"> mouse worked as great . egornocal hand grip , on/off switch to conserves power , and sleep mode blue light features are added bonus . i love the invisible optic laser ( compared to other mouse 's bright red light shinning into my face when i look the buttom of the mouse to turn off the mouce ) </seg>
<seg id="1"> not much i can say . ram makes great products and i have an assortment of pieces that i can swap and interchange between bikes and devices . </seg>
<seg id="1"> this is very good original canon lens . i got it in a bundle with the canon t4i with a instant rebate of 150 $ .great deal ! </seg>
<seg id="1"> my cable got stuck and broke in the steering wheel , this cable replaced it . not much more to say other than it works . </seg>
<seg id="1"> functionality is at it states , however , it 's more of a drab burgundy color ... definately not purple . sleep/wake function works well too . </seg>
<seg id="1"> i am not going to go in details but as mentioned by many , this device rocks . you must have co-ax wiring in your house to use this . you can use splitter with this if you have only one coax connection to wall and currently that one is used by your existing cable modem . i use this for windows media center extender ( xbox 360 ) to stream live tv . earlier i had lot of disturbance on the wireless but now absolutely no issues . great technology ! </seg>
<seg id="1"> this is a very nice adapter kit . seems that no reader reads these tiny cards . so you need an adapter . this works great . my only complaint is that the micro card is a bit hard to get out of the adapter . at least it is for me and that may just be because i 'm all thumbs . </seg>
<seg id="1"> best purchase ever , inexpensive yet powerful . great purchase . highly recommend it to anyone looking for small and powerful speakers . has an aux input on one of the speakers which is nice . </seg>
<seg id="1"> i have been very pleased with this power supply . it has been operating every day for the past month since i bought it and it has been working fine . i may soon be getting a battery on here to as im down to an hour on a full charge but it did that before the new charger . i say order this one over the cheaper ones that have iffy ratings . the low raters are liers if you ask me there is nothing wrong with this charger . </seg>
<seg id="1"> this works . it blocks the vent almost compltely when it use , and its n't very adjustable , but it hold the gps securely . </seg>
<seg id="1"> i like the smart cover . not sure if the one i got was legit from apple though , or if it had been sitting around getting de-magnetized for a while . the spine attached very securely , but the outer edge that flips around and attaches to itself to act as a stand for the ipad is weak , and causes the the ipad to flop over and collapse with minimal touching/swiping on the screen . </seg>
<seg id="1"> while i hiked a nearby hill , i was able to talk to my kids inside a walmart building in the valley 6 miles away . very impressed . also this walkie talkie is light and compact . great for outdoors hiking . </seg>
<seg id="1"> i love my hard drive , it works perfect and its has a really good capacity to hold all my information , i got everything there . and i feel secure of all my things are save and protect </seg>
<seg id="1"> this product was a gift . so far so good . no bad report from the source . </seg>
<seg id="1"> i have a spare 2.5 hd from an old pc and just needs some housing to use it . ordered one of this and works for the purpose . </seg>
<seg id="1"> works as advertised on a motherboard not in compatibility list . usb very fast compared to 2.0 and sata quick as well , will be much faster in 4x slot i 'm sure as i have it in 1x slot . </seg>
<seg id="1"> very easy to hook up . i do n't have any outdoor plugs , so in went the aa batteries . i love the fact that the transmitter has component audio ( red & white cables ) so i could plug them into the back of my stereo and have all of that hidden , and not have to fuss with a headphone cable and allows me to have audio both inside and out . this is a keeper ! </seg>
<seg id="1"> ok so it 's not a canon part , but seriously it 's just a plastic lens hood . the oem part is shamefully overpriced . this works fine for me . i 'd prefer to tinkle away my money on other things . it was out of stock for along time . </seg>
<seg id="1"> i always buy amazon basics lighting cables for my ios devices . best price & very durable </seg>
<seg id="1"> belkin 6-outlet surge protector 2-pack with 2 feet cord via amazon for great price , simple set-up for laptop , phone charger , lamp etc next to favorite chair in living room . metal oxide varistors ( movs ) absorb excess electricity for basic protection ; dont believe there is a better deal for 9.99 with prime shipping too ; - > so i did n't bother looking much online for better prices/items . to easy </seg>
<seg id="1"> the strap works well with my nikon aw110 camera , it makes it float . the downside i 'd the length connecting string to the camera is short . it makes it difficult to hold the camera when on your wrist . </seg>
<seg id="1"> i love the look of this mouse , also love the tiny little usb stick - i have another wireless mouse but its stick is huge . this is really pretty blue with nice flower designs , works great , does exactly what it 's supposed to </seg>
<seg id="1"> i did n't know that it was possible to have a usb this slow . i ca n't complain much , it was cheap . but honestly i do n't think that it is morally right to sell a usb drive this slow ... we are not in the 1990 's . </seg>
<seg id="1"> this is a pretty average bag . it does n't give a whole lot of space for anything , it is pretty small if that 's what your looking for . it 's not a bad quality , but i think there are probably better bags out there . a lot of bags out there are much more expensive than this , and i kinda think this is a `` you get what you pay for '' kind of thing . </seg>
<seg id="1"> i use mine inside a dash camera which records continuously while the car is being driven . no problems so far . having the sd adapter included is nice . </seg>
<seg id="1"> i followed the instructions for install and have had no problems with my windows 7 64 bit ( home premium ) setup . one caveat : the install disk is a mini-cd ... you need to have a tray , not slot , cd or dvd drive to use this for install . you can clone the disk to a usb drive and install from there if you have a tray drive on one computer and need to install on a slot-only laptop , for example . </seg>
<seg id="1"> i purchased this for use with the westcott rapid box . it does a much better job at distributing the light then using the westcott rapid box without it . i just wish they would have included this automatically with the westcott rapid box . </seg>
<seg id="1"> would purchase again . have n't used it yet but i got it really fast . i would reccommend this to friends for sure . </seg>
<seg id="1"> terrific results that one would have a hard time getting on a sunny day without it . it also tames industrial scenes just like it was designed for . on an artistic level , 10 stops allows for some serious creativity . and just like every other b+w filter i own it 's built like a tank ... and short of dropping it in the ocean it will probably be with me forever . </seg>
<seg id="1"> at $ 18 ( when i got it ) , it was a good price and has worked out great on my canon 70-200 f/4 is . no complaints . </seg>
<seg id="1"> a necessary product for canon tele converter lens ... the material is plastic rather than metal it works fine be careful not to `` cross thread '' the lens and do n't tighten it to much a light snug fit will work . i never remove it ... makes a fine lens hood . </seg>
<seg id="1"> this is awesome for tight space , like behind something heavy . the pivot outlets really make a difference . you can alternate and pivot some to the side and some in front . it 's a good product and a good purchase . the price is always right on amazon . </seg>
<seg id="1"> our 8 year old samsung dlp was whining and discontinued after i replaced the color wheel . i highly suggest watching a you tube video prior to taking things apart . it 's amazingly simple but i failed to reconnect one cable at the end and came very close to calling a technician to come out till i took a nice long deep breath along with several beers and went back through each step . i realized that i failed to reconnect the internal power cable when i put everything back together . patience & organization is key . </seg>
<seg id="1"> purchased this for our driveway ( which is about 100 feet from the receiver ) and it would n't work . we tested and found that it would n't work beyond 35 feet - which just is n't practical . even then , the motion detector worked about 20 % of the time at best . i guess you get what you pay for . </seg>
<seg id="1"> this is junk ! the charger does n't fit well in your iphone and you have to hold it in to charge , , do n't purchase it because it is junk . </seg>
<seg id="1"> these speakers/subwoofer sound amazing , totally blow away my old onkyo set , both in performance and size ( less than 1/3 the size ) . i picked them up on amazon for $ 299 on sale and feel the value is fantastic . would definitely buy again , sound quality is amazing with my new yamaha rx-v473 . </seg>
<seg id="1"> this is an extra battery for the camera i have . works great . just like the one that came with the original . </seg>
<seg id="1"> bought these for a canon powershot sx510 hs . works great and no issues with speed or data loss . for what i use them for , i do n't see any difference in performance between these and the really expensive versions . </seg>
<seg id="1"> i received this product in a timely manner . it met all expectation and was what i wanted . did not encounter any problem connecting and using it . </seg>
<seg id="1"> the hard case is a little bit cheap of material , you can easily see smudges on it , but it does the job of protecting your laptop and is firmly in place . keyboard protector is great , never slips off , all though it does take some getting used because it makes the keys a bit thicker . </seg>
<seg id="1"> works fine , had no problems . now i have tons of space on my galaxy note 10.1. saved a lot of money buying it on amazon </seg>
<seg id="1"> i purchased this cable to run along the outside wall of the living room so we can watch things on the tv directly from the computer and still have the computer next to us on the couch . it works great and for a 50 ' cable was a great price . i have seen no problems with lag , quality drop , or interference . </seg>
<seg id="1"> i purchased this as a present for my son who enjoys this product very much to store all of his music on to listen to in the car </seg>
<seg id="1"> this controller ca n't turn off the fan completely likemanual 12v dc variable speed controller 4 pin molex to dual 3 pin connectorcan , and the maximum output is 11v , not 12v . so you 'll loose about 9 % fan speed on 12v fans . </seg>
<seg id="1"> a classy frame that works without problems . the included software installed easily and works the same way . a nice , boredom fighting addition to the office desktop . </seg>
<seg id="1"> i bought this for a canon slr camera . it does n't match up with my camera strap hole on the camera but it attaches and knots just fine on the wrist strap i have . i just wanted a neck strap so i do n't have to keep it on my wrist all the time . for me , it 's just right . the neck portion of the strap is comfortable . i love it ! </seg>
<seg id="1"> bought this as a gift for my granddaughter . she seems to be delighted with it so i guess i did good . </seg>
<seg id="1"> i bought this to upgrade from 1 gb of memory . works fine , easy to install . my mobo allows only 2 gb of memory in two slots ( it only has two slots ) </seg>
<seg id="1"> excellent quality and on time delivery . in particular the cable covering is very soft and pliable which makes the cables easy to use vs. cheap plastic sheathing that is stiff and hard to work with . i recommend them highly . </seg>
<seg id="1"> i really like this belkin kitchen stand . i can finally use my ipad in the kitchen without worrying about it falling over . the only reason i dropped one star is that the stylus takes getting used to . you have to be a little more firm with it than you would a standard stylus . other than that , especially for the price , i highly recommend this product . </seg>
<seg id="1"> i would give 10 stars if that was possible . i have been so disappointed with other screen protectors , i did n't have any hope even with this one , but i hate to leave my ipad screen unprotected since it gets so much use from my nieces and nephews . i was very pleased as how easy it was for even me to install . this stuff is awesome ! ! ! ! </seg>
<seg id="1"> mouse is as described . better product than i thought , comes with batter and i did n't realize it had an on/off switch . works great . </seg>
<seg id="1"> it works great ... not much else to say . hooked up fine . looks great on the desk . quiet . good buy overall . </seg>
<seg id="1"> i bought this to put into an enclosure . large capacity at a good price . still running to this day without a problem . </seg>
<seg id="1"> really easy . open up the pc , pop them in , start up ... go . really , really easy . could n't be happier with these . </seg>
<seg id="1"> i bought this camera as a gift for my wife to replace her canon s1 . she finds the camera shape very comfortable to hold . too many cameras are awkward to hold . this one is n't . picture quality is excellent . shooting speed is very quick . the image stabilization insures sharp pictures . controls are logically placed and easy to operate . unlike my minolta , this camera does n't get accidentally turned on when placing it in a camera case . </seg>
<seg id="1"> exactly what i was expecting . i can use a keyboard , mouse , usb drive , external hard drive , and more with my nexus 5 . </seg>
<seg id="1"> cant complain especially this purchase was the first high end video card i got in years . the software that comes with it makes , overclocking it a breeze . also this card can handle 4 monitor screens , dont need a second one ! it does kinda get loud though when its being pushed but then again its added positve effect for me when im playing flying simulations : ) </seg>
<seg id="1"> this hdmi cable was used to connect my new sony cd / dvd player to mypioneer home theatre system . a quality made hdmi cable , compared to others . the cable is well built , not cheaply made . the price was great . i 'm very new to hdmi cables but i choose to educatemyself about them and their functions . i will purchase another one when needed . mediabridge is located in cherry hill , nj and you can call the company for help / information , and they really do return your telephone calls . </seg>
<seg id="1"> fits well . look and feel just like the original ones . it took some efforts to put them on but not too difficult . </seg>
<seg id="1"> unlike the last two covers i bought which immediately began showing signs of wear with fraying edges , i 've had no issues with this one . the color is lovely , the lining and notches are perfect , and everything works as expected . one tip for buyers : when rotating , you may need to adjust the back of the cover slightly to make it stand up straight . it 's quick and certainly not a deal breaker . </seg>
<seg id="1"> im very impressed with this board and especially for the money . very well made , bios is a breeze , lots of usb ports and 4 usb 3.0 ports on board . im running amd fx 8350 8 core black edition , 16 gb vengeance ram , with evga gtx 650ti boost sc 2gb . </seg>
<seg id="1"> still looking for a decent polaroid camera to use the film with , but so far the images come out relatively clear . hopefully i will find a better camera down the road that will give me the crystal-clear shots i know this film is capable of doing . </seg>
<seg id="1"> bought this because of the great reviews . it is all that it says it is . very nice and very handy . well made and stays on . the tablet can be charged in the case , even on the charging dock . </seg>
<seg id="1"> i bought this due to a high review rating and a unique curve designed . i had at least 15 hours of pure typing on it already and feels great . also it 's not as loud when you type compared to other keyboards . </seg>
<seg id="1"> so , pros : it has a scroll wheelit functions as advertisedcons : does not have an analog stickis extremely uncomfortableis loudkeys are often hard to reachlong story short drop the extra 10 $ or so and get the g 13 it has more features and it just a better product . sorry razer i really wanted to like this but honestly its just sub par for the price . </seg>
<seg id="1"> i bought the 2x teleconverter lens because i needed more zoom and did not have the money at the present time to buy a high price longer range lens . i use this 2x lens extender with my 70-300mm lens . you have to use manual focus with this setup , but i use manual focus most of the time anyway , so it 's no problem for me . i would recommend this 2x lens extender to anyone who needs more range but does not have the extra money to spend on a longer range lens . </seg>
<seg id="1"> this are great all-purpose earbuds that fit comfortable and have a choice of inserts . i especially like the built in dial volume control . </seg>
<seg id="1"> my wife likes it very much . gives her the protection she needed for kindle inside her pocket book . highly recommended . </seg>
<seg id="1"> got this for my toshiba thrive . fits perfectly . and you ca n't beat the price ( ~ $ 19 ) . the keyboard is comfortable , works well , and is an excellent size . very happy with my purchase . ( i am actually writing this up on my thrive using this case ) . </seg>
<seg id="1"> is a great product . now my sansa 260 does n't need an umbilical cord to a computer ! ! ! ! </seg>
<seg id="1"> it does the job . it is 10 feet of hi-speed usb 2.0 cable , lol , what more can i say ! it worked ! did n't need to send it back ! </seg>
<seg id="1">  </seg>
<seg id="1"> i like this radio but for a 2014 model the screen resolution does n't seem that good . in addition they make you purchase other cords in order to fully integrate your smartphone . did n't like that at all since the other cords come out to around $ 80-90 . i had an older out dated alpine unit and it seemed to do just as much . pioneer needs to step it up if this is their flagship for 2014. i would browse around some more before deciding on this one </seg>
<seg id="1"> i purchased this battery to replace a & # 34 ; swelling & # 34 ; batter for my old mac book . it 's not an official apple product , and it 's still a little thicker than it should be , but it gets the job done and was way less expensive than trying to get an official replacement . </seg>
<seg id="1">  </seg>
<seg id="1"> cheap and works . what more could you ask for . i have no problems with battery life . would recommend this product . </seg>
<seg id="1"> i use this with my sony hdr xr-520 when i go `` ghost hunting '' . nice ir light with an adjuster dial to control the amount of light you want to use . i use rechargeable aa batteries with this light . nice purchase ! </seg>
<seg id="1"> very nice ups . i am happy with my purchase and it work as should . the informative lcd screen is a great addition . we use a larger one in our business so i went with the same brand . could n't be happier . </seg>
<seg id="1"> i must have had this for more than a year and it works . i only use it for backup , once a month or so . so i have no idea how it would stand up to more punishing use . </seg>
