<seg id="1"> not one problem after 1 year of use . i was really hesitant on buying into the ssd technology after all the reports of ssd 's gone bad , but this has proven to be very worth it . </seg>
<seg id="2"> this unit is pretty quiet and moves a good amount of air for a great price . i 've used these in some systems that required a lower profile unit than the larger cooler master coolers i use in my larger systems . i 've been very happy with them . they do a great job for their size . </seg>
<seg id="3"> first one broke after a couple of months . but this one has a long range ( 2 floors ) and slim and comfortable . buttons feel great too ( they are spaced ) </seg>
<seg id="4"> these screen protectors arrived quickly after ordering . everything needed for installation was in the package . after cleaning my screen , the protector went on quickly and is a perfect fit for my ellipsis 7 . </seg>
<seg id="5"> ordered this gps early for a trip and failed right out of the box . purchased from amazon marketplace thru ace digital photo . since it was over 14 days , i had to contact bushnell and pay for return shipping to repair . unable toreach bushnell for 2 days and 4 times each attempt ( recording kept saying `` hi volume of calls '' ) ... no help at all . lesson learned : never buy things early and never from amazon again if this does n't get resolved . </seg>
<seg id="6"> it is just as it says it is ... i have this hooked up to a second router to further my wifi distance and i have no problems with speed flux . good product ... cheap price ! </seg>
<seg id="7"> this sony 3d blu-ray disk player replaced one which had failed which was many years old . enjoy the blu-ray and am looking toward trying 3d . </seg>
<seg id="8"> very user friendlygood resultmuch easier to use and instantaneous result , much easier than other router extension that i have </seg>
<seg id="9"> i tested it with a sanyo mp3 player , its output added less than 10 % . this is not even worth trying , its a waste of money . </seg>
<seg id="10"> this seems to be a very good product i had to reset my keyboard once again other than that all seems well i 'm looking forward to getting the keyboard k 811 to go with this </seg>
<seg id="11"> bought this to replace the standard neck strap that came with my g15 camera . this strap is great and seems to be a perfect fit with the camera . as a couple of other reviewers have stated you can not 'cinch ' the wrist strap around your arm , which would be nice , although for me i do not feel like there is a risk of it falling off while walking around due to the material inside the strap and the width of it . </seg>
<seg id="12"> i 've built two systems using this case and if you want a case that fits into your media center with your receiver etc . this is a good choice . it accepts standard size power supplies but does not pay a significant penalty in size in doing so . </seg>
<seg id="13"> good , it is what it is . </seg>
<seg id="14"> this more than meets my needs to protect my ipad . the only thing i would have asked for is a placeto put my pen when i put the item away . it does hold the item satisfactorily in any position . </seg>
<seg id="15"> would have given it a 5 star , but it gave me one problem . since then no problem at all . the price was outstanding considering what my friends paid for theirs . amazon got me spoiled . i am able to see netflix without going to my laptop . </seg>
<seg id="16"> works how it should with a catch ; ssds cause the per-drive light to end up being somewhat pinkish . i am not sure why but it does n't affect the drive at all . i wish the fan they used was a bit quieter . i have the fan on mine set to low and it 's still the loudest one in my case while my pc is idling . </seg>
<seg id="17"> after looking at what seemed to be a million headphones , i settled on the shures and they have turned out to be excellent . they 're for the average home listener/producer . light , crisp and clean lows , mids , and highs , and great for the $ $ $ you spend ! </seg>
<seg id="18"> this thing is super fast and has breathed new life into my 13in macbook pro . the load times are mere seconds for all my apps , even games , and it boots in under 7 seconds ! i have had it for about a year now and it is still going strong . i would definitely recommend this product . </seg>
<seg id="19"> this is one of the best purchases we have made . we use this with netflix and we no longer run out of things to watch ! we use it with our laptops , and now my ipad mini ... works like a charm ! we even use it to cast local sports that are only on espn online ... awesome ! </seg>
<seg id="20"> as some call this type of gps , `` lite '' it works just fine knowing the three distances . most rounds are on my home courseso i have a built in advantage . charges quickly and is about a third charge left when finishing a 4-4.5 hour round . screen is large and plainly visible even in bright sunlight . only fault is that it will fluctuate on certain holes and distancessometimes by 4-5 yards while standing still . for the money it 's a great deal . </seg>
<seg id="21"> i have been using this item for some time and i love the keyboard , and the mouse has a decent range . </seg>
<seg id="22"> works as advertised . ordered a bunch in different capacities and had zero failures . good packaging and each has it 's own case . will keep buying for my trail cameras ! </seg>
<seg id="23"> pretty stiff . very well constructed . great looking cable . you wont mind having this out where it can be seen . another get you one ! cable . </seg>
<seg id="24"> this receiver is great . it has multiple video output formats ( composite , component and hdmi ) in case your current tv ( or monitor ) is not hdmi . this worked out great , since the tv this is hooked up to is an older tv with no hdmi input . this receiver also has 3d passthrough and 4k upscaling for use by the latest tvs . </seg>
<seg id="25"> i use 2 of these cards with a canon eos 5d mark ii . they are fast enough , large enough , and reliable . </seg>
<seg id="26"> this moves a lot of air . i wish things like this air blaster were not necessary , but it is needed by just about any photographer that changes lenses at one time or another . a tiny spec of dust on the sensor is about as annoying to get rid of as a thorn embedded in your heel , awkward and difficult without the right tools . sometimes a blast of air works , sometimes a blast of air makes the situation worse . either way , this is a must have . </seg>
<seg id="27"> fits any laptop and the 5 volt usb powered fan is quiet yet effective . even if you do n't need the fan , this targus makes a really good work platform for the computer . i own 3 of these and each one works perfectly . </seg>
<seg id="28"> i did n't realize how small it was at first , but i love it . works great with windows 8 and my surface , perfect travel companion . love that it is bluetooth as well , i do n't even need to bother plugging in a usb . </seg>
<seg id="29"> solid build . seems very durable , well made . gold plated , no noticeable sound distortion . does what it is supposed to do </seg>
<seg id="30"> this one does all i need . it is basic a linux server so you can do a lot of things with this after you set up ssh access . i 'm satisfied with the speed , but it is a little noisy with the click sound . </seg>
<seg id="31"> bought it to replace another maker 's unit that died . this one controls a cable box from another room about 30 ft away . works great . and the price is reasonable . no regrets . </seg>
<seg id="32"> i looked at several different products and after speaking with several folks about it , this one was right up my alley . if you want a camera that 's a lot better than a pocket camera , but you do n't want to pay the price for a professional camera , this is for you . i suggest buying a nice lens for the camera as well . </seg>
<seg id="33"> i have some case logic cases too . i have ordered this one for my old and precious point and shoot camera , canon ixus 75. it fits great . thin and has pocket for backup battery and memory card . basically , it 's doing its job very well . </seg>
<seg id="34"> i drive a truck , and use these daily . they hold up for generally at least 6 months which is a lot longer than other chargers under $ 10 . i have n't ordered a different charger since i came across this , and the first one i bought outlasted the $ 25 charger from the sprint store . great purchase , and i 'm sure these would last a year or more if you do n't use them numerous times a dayan easy 5 star rating </seg>
<seg id="35"> bought this too quick without looking at the speed , ca n't use it for any real file transfer speed . not worth even using for wireless keyboard or mouse ... . </seg>
<seg id="36"> i got tired of suction-cup-to-windshield gps attachments . they sometimes block my view when traveling on twisting roads , and have lost suction and dropped on the floor too many times . that 's dangerous safety lapse , to me . it does n't matter how hard i break or how sharp the curve , this friction mount keeps the gps where i need it . </seg>
<seg id="37"> this was well worth the money i paid for it , i love the design , fold up real nice , hold the ipad very sturdy . my wife loves her 's also . ca n't beat it for the price . it has real nice foam pads . it 's adjustable viewing angle make is real usable . </seg>
<seg id="38"> we have a terrible time with phone reception at our location , so when i ordered our panasonic phones , i ordered this to make sure we could get good reception on the occasions when we need to use the phones outdoors . so far we have n't had to use this , so i 'm not sure if it works or not . i am very impressed with our phones and the reception though . </seg>
<seg id="39"> even though this is listed for ipads , i got it for a le pan ii ( model 979 ) which fits beautifully inside and does not cover up any of the access buttons or the webcam . case is very well made and sturdy and protects my tablet perfectly while also allowing me to stand it up if i need to when it 's in use . </seg>
<seg id="40"> this produces big and bold sound . the bass works well but it seems very muddy to us . adjusting all your song using the equalizer helps a little but it takes time . it 's also a bummer you ca n't turn the ipad sideways since that 's the way to watch movies . you can lean the ipad on its side and plug it in but it wo n't be charging . it 's a good system if you keep those drawbacks in mind . </seg>
<seg id="41"> its a great ssd drive and installed easy in my alienware x51 gaming computer . very fast ! highly recommended to people that want an even faster pc experience . </seg>
<seg id="42"> i ordered this for my daughter and since its just so expensive and i guess this is a dying form of photography </seg>
<seg id="43"> extremely pleased with the quality of the cables . works exceptionally well with 3d hd tv . plan on purchasing more cables in coming weeks . ca n't beat the price ! </seg>
<seg id="44"> my wife needed an external simple to hook up and use dvd writer and reader . she has an older computer and windows xp pro . this fit her needs . plus she can take it with her to other places </seg>
<seg id="45"> i do n't have any complaints to make . works great and way better than my old radio transmitter . i did n't even know my car stereo could go that loud ! </seg>
<seg id="46"> cat 6 cable , ca n't beat the price/quality ratio of the cable . i now have a gigabit home network . thanks ! it was shipped quickly as well ! thanks ! </seg>
<seg id="47"> great car dvr for about 20 bucks . driving in la and ca n't trust anyone these days so a dvr is a must . </seg>
<seg id="48"> it 's a good swivel holder , but the cold shoe that comes with it is a pos . soft metal , the screws strip out without even putting any pressure on them ! if you 've got your own cold shoes , or do n't need them , this is great . otherwise ? might want to go with a different swivel holder . </seg>
<seg id="49"> decent quality expected from hp . it does a good the job with no problems . i pick this hp because we already other similar hp managed switches . </seg>
<seg id="50"> great </seg>
<seg id="51"> i dont know why are there so many 1 star reviews when it comes to the red ligthed mouse of this kind . i just got mine , and works great , it 's a budget mouse that does the job . the only thing worth mentioning is that the mouse is really flat , it makes my hand hurt at first then i get use to it..forget using this mouse as a gaming mouse , you 're gon na have a bad time5 star because it 's perfect for me </seg>
<seg id="52"> i got this unit installed in a pt cruiser with a 10 inch sub . it rocks the car really well , but if you trying to rattle the house windows on the street , this is not the unit for you . it will make a world of difference for your system . kinda fills in the bottom end of the spectrum . it will impress you in the car , not them on the street ! </seg>
<seg id="53"> i have 2 backups that needed this battery as i had them 3 years - so easy to change out ( although there were no instruction , i found it on the web ) , but like i said , very easy to install , so i am good to go another 3 years , ordered another one from same company . </seg>
<seg id="54"> great product for a great price ... certainly a quick resource when you are considering what adjustments to make to your camera 's settings for that `` perfect picture '' ! </seg>
<seg id="55"> this is my second case for my kindle . they work very well and i find them to be worth every penny . i read every day and it is nice to be able to change the position of the kindle to relax my wrists . </seg>
<seg id="56"> i like the look of it but if its bright you wont be able to see the screen very well . pretty good feeling for keeping the pod safe . overall i like it enough to recommend </seg>
<seg id="57"> purchased this to add to my existing home wifi network . we had several rooms with dead spots due to the location of my existing wifi access point . i ran new cat-5e and set this up near center of house and had little trouble configuring the network settings . now i have full bars on all wifi devices in every room ! great product ! </seg>
<seg id="58"> i ordered two of these cables , one for me and one for my son , and we both love them ! the price is unbeatable , shipping was extremely fast and the cable is excellent . i highly recommend this and the micro hdmi to use with your smart phone -- which i also ordered and am very pleased with as well . </seg>
<seg id="59"> got one for my work , got one ofr my office . flashed the one at home , did n't have to do anything to the one at workasus has amazing products , just awful customer support.thats why i buy them through amazon.either way , amazing product , great speeds , range of the wifi is awsome as well.has many features that only come on $ 300+ routers.most likely will get another one here </seg>
<seg id="60"> easy setup.you can hook it under most dell monitor . sound quality is better than those 10 bucks speakers.con : the sky blue indicator on the middle of the speaker is kinda annoy . </seg>
<seg id="61"> ok the batteries are great last as long as the go-pro batteries . i have been using these batteries on a regular and have had not one problem with them . thank you smatree for a great product at an affordable price . </seg>
<seg id="62"> out of the box you have to setup the belt manually , which i messed up at first by not sliding it down far enough . this caused the records to play too fast , but i realised i probably did something wrong and fixed it right away . other than that it works great , no complaints . </seg>
<seg id="63"> got this to plug into my at &amp; t microcell , i still ca n't get a gps lock . my cellphone works in the same location . </seg>
<seg id="64"> got this for my girlfriends daughter and she seemed to be impressed with the product . it serve a use that she has for it . </seg>
<seg id="65"> a simple file copy test shows : write : 17 mb/sread : 20 mb/sslightly less than the claimed speed but close . </seg>
<seg id="66"> screen protector for apple ipod nano 6th generation -3 packthe size is little bigger than my screen , easy off </seg>
<seg id="67"> it 's tricky to setup and use , but once done appears to be fine . costs less than canon version . needs a longer power cord . would recommend . </seg>
<seg id="68"> i 'd had quite a few previously viwed dvds that had scratches . as a result , my dvd player would freeze . this product fixed a couple of dvds for me . as far as the haze , you can use a lint free cloth to wipe the haze or a bottle of optrix afterwards . i stopped buying dvds new unless i can get them via gift card or in a bargain bin . </seg>
<seg id="69"> my dvr ( magnavox ) was starting to act up when recording to a dvd . i began to see bad spots randomly on the finalized disc and eventually they became so bad that the discs were useless . i ordered this hoping that it would make a difference and it did ! i ran the cleaning cycle twice and now the dvr records like it was new . </seg>
<seg id="70"> the case arrived very quickly . the color was pleasing and the case was of very good quality.it was easy to place the ipad mini into the case , and the fit was very good . excellent case for the money..good protection </seg>
<seg id="71"> good price , great functionality , quick to ship , fits on all my lenses including the filters , plus it looks cool , what 's not to love ? </seg>
<seg id="72"> sound quality is top notch and the ear pieces are extremely cushioned for a great feel . best headset i 've ever owned . </seg>
<seg id="73"> wanted earbuds with mic and controls and this fit the bill and the price was cheap . nuff said so just buy them ! </seg>
<seg id="74"> overall the sound quality is very good . the ear cushions are too small to fit over your ear and are uncomfortable to wear . the head band is marked with a l and a r but it is marked the wrong way to have the headband parallel to your head which makes me wonder which speaker is wired right and which is left . i mostly use these for watching movies and which side is which can make a big difference . all in all i 'm going to buy a different headset in the near future . </seg>
<seg id="75"> i 've tried many rechargeable batteries throughout the years and always came away slightly disappointed by their performance . these eneloops are the first rechargeable batteries in which i am more than satisfied with how well they retain their charge , both in-use and in storage . i have replaced all household battery-operated devices with these eneloops . </seg>
<seg id="76"> started out great . interesting to see how some youtube videos look better than cable on 50 '' tv , while most look and sound meh or worse . but now , 3 months after using it , about half the videos on youtube are legally prohibited to be used with this device in the us ( music licensing ) .save your $ . </seg>
<seg id="77"> very happy with the cables . very happy with the price i got them for . in the stores they want outrageous prices and i just could not see spending that kind of money . i am glad i got these through amazon . </seg>
<seg id="78"> i got this less than 30 days ago . it is designed to protect the kindle by closing like a book when not in use . i have never closed it . i put it on , and used the elastic strap to keep it open . so it has not been closed even once . that being said , it about fell apart . every seam on the plastic front page is destroyed , separated open and unrepairable . this item is junk </seg>
<seg id="79"> this is our first experience with a digital camera . it is a camera easy to use for the novice and has the bells and whistles the experienced or serious digital camera user demands . super easy to connect to the computer with the usb cable supplied . we think this gives more bang for the buck than any we have looked at . love it . </seg>
<seg id="80"> have a canon 7d and got two of this two months ago . withen 60 days they and the charger had stopped working . contacted vendor and they said `` tough luck-we have a 14 day warranty '' ! ! what a load ! ! amazon 's `` a-z '' guarantee is equially a joke . they took a week and then said their was nothing they could do . do n't buy this product ! </seg>
<seg id="81"> i bought this looking for a controller that would be more suitable for mmo 's than a keyboard and it certainly fits the bill . fits my hand very well . some keys are a little bit difficult to reach without movement of my palm but other than that it is superb . setting keys is very easy and i have no complaints ! </seg>
<seg id="82"> i have never been a fan of harmony remotes but gave this one a chance because of the cheap price , compared to other harmony remote . i just want a remote that can work mt tv , directv dvr , tivo , and blu-ray . this remote ca n't do it . i have a cheap sony universal remote that could but i dropped it one too many times and needed a replacement . i guess i will be looking for a sony again . </seg>
<seg id="83"> use them outside hooked up to thepyle home pca2 mini 2 x 40-watt stereo power amplifierand it provides a decent amount of power . sound quality is pretty good too . they have been heavily rained on as well and are still working as well as the first day . </seg>
<seg id="84"> works great in a samsung phone . easy to use , get to , and can take some punishment ... i 'll be buying more soon </seg>
<seg id="85"> it serves its purpose , but i was disappointed to find out that you have to pull on both ends at the same time in order to extend it or activate its retracting mechanism . it would be much nicer if you only had to pull on one side . </seg>
<seg id="86"> this is the one to buy if you are doing a lot of graphic work , it is a solid performer , and does quite well in gaming also . for the price you can not go wrong . </seg>
<seg id="87"> i 'm really disappointed of this product . i can not find any `` super bass '' they said . the bass is much much less than their even low-priced earbuds such as mx560 ... actually the bass is almost non-existent . considering the high pitch is clear and crispy , i decided not to give it a 1 star comment but 2 . </seg>
<seg id="88"> i use this power adapter in my second car . all i have to do is disconnect the tuner from one vehicle and move it without moving the power adapter from my main vehicle . works great . </seg>
<seg id="89"> excellent construction , good materials , all m microphones fit perfectly with enough room for 3 clips and 2 cables . great look , too . </seg>
<seg id="90"> these turn themselves off randomly when you set them down on a counter . not reliable . bummer cause you dont know they are off unless you look . would also be nice if they had an end of transmission beep so you know when someone is done . </seg>
<seg id="91"> i 've had this bag pack for many years . it is rugged and perfect for a commuter . i 've taken it through air ports , mountains , metro stations , buses , school campus.. it has taken all the beating in the world . it got dirty so i washed it ... no issues whatsoever.. i would highly recommend this and the only reason i 'd replace it would be to buy something newer . i do n't think it will ever rip apart . </seg>
<seg id="92"> this cable just does what it claims . the connectors fit our computer and new monitor just right and the resulting picture is flawless . the price is great . the value is excellent . </seg>
<seg id="93"> easy peasey , could not be easier . works great ! just plugged it in , pressed wps on my router and i was ready to go . </seg>
<seg id="94"> works great with my iphone 3g . it does give a warning message stating that the device is incompatible , but it works anyways ( i had this with my old fm transmitter as well ) . there is a little static , but it is unrecognizable most of the time while music is playing . the channel scanner works better than my old model itrip . i would recommend this to any iphone owner . </seg>
<seg id="95"> but it does work . why in the hell it costs as much as it does is simply due to robbery . but it functions and is of decent quality . not exactly a complex piece of equipment . </seg>
<seg id="96"> this is ok for the mini apple ipad but the price was n't good deal at all . i could n't return last time because the cost of shipping it back to seller . it does n't not stand up well keep fallen off . </seg>
<seg id="97"> i have been complete satisfied with this product . it has worked with every item i have connected to it and with all operating systems that i have used it with . </seg>
<seg id="98"> i got my camera with just the body , this is the kit lens . it 's a good lens , if you 're concerned with autofocus speed , look for a usm lens . </seg>
<seg id="99"> base is very good overall a great addition to a home theater sized tv . like many reviewers it would have been perfect if the rear speakers would have connected wirelessly via blue tooth to get rid of those wires . </seg>
<seg id="100"> it 's a cable ... get over it ! it seems sturdy enough and it passes all the signals i put in at one end . also , it does n't smell funny . </seg>
