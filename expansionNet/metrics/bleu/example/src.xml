<seg id="1"> i love the idea that this keyboard is exactly the same as all the other ones out there but for a fraction of the price ! do n't waste your money on a 20 dollar version either ! it paired with my nexus 7 nicely and i believe it will connect with any blue tooth enabled device without fail . the keys are big enough and perfect for typing out essays and reports for those awful college classes i know everyone has to take . </seg>
