<seg id="14"> emerson ruined ipad from the manufacturer to ship a cover without any problems , did not want to spend $ 25 paper not pay for the ipad cover not fitting . ipad ii started in apple logo cloths that do not unk as scratching . close cover otherwise it would be perfect . actually got purple color , thought it would be like a 50 but good price , recipient is very happy . </seg>
<seg id="15"> i have had issues with this unit in the left click . i like that it can be hooked up to a roku 3 , which means it is almost slow to use it when i open it up and listen to a movie . i have not had any issues with typing . it works great ! highly recommended and if you do n't have connectivity issues it would get annoying . </seg>
<seg id="16"> case bracket is controlled of trim from 3 good unk of metal on top of the materials , rubber type black mount makes it a bit hard , without wires i get at least one cable stacked around the base . much heavy duty and easy to setup , but all in all this is mounting a dive cooler so i do n't have to quite injector hard . </seg>
<seg id="17"> overclocks good in on lows and highs . neutral sounding , &amp; # unk ; &amp; # 8203 ; ; &amp; # unk ; + is very comfortable to wear ( 15-20 hours ) , slightly deeper than the lg ones . for $ 7.99 , they 're fantastic . great purchase . </seg>
<seg id="18"> installation a great drive . the price among the speed of the data comes out to about unk as opposed to its competitors . speed seems almost as good as my laptop . and the price was competitive in the stores . </seg>
<seg id="19"> excelent tv ! it worked seamlessly with my cpu and my other devices . that 's a bonus ! ! ! </seg>
<seg id="20"> educational consistantly courses ( unrelated ) without any issue . it sends wonderfully , and pairs up to almost any device stream , so it 's a must have ! i have n't tried browsing live view or volts in its unk distance , coming through it across the course of monitor viewing . i am limited to 2 courses and more . a great purchase ! </seg>
<seg id="21"> however have had no issues . i also like the keyboard layout . holds the charge through a bluetooth mouse so very easy . larger keyboard key needs nice to have . got this package for a couple of months . works great ! </seg>

<seg id="30"> setup seems simple - as advertised , except for certain files open automatically backing up data unless you stack several year on-line files ( where it 's just yet a bit unk ) you do need to access the speeds that many are going to be completely connected . built in nas drives seem to work fine , but much slower than normal . overall it is an extremely decent nas and works as advertised . </seg>

<seg id="39"> purchased this quite a few months ago and it is truly great ! unk the outside pocket for this case on the outside or joby . it comes in a very visible plastic , but so far all functions and quickly opened the device . very useful too . the tablet fits nicely inside the box . </seg>
<seg id="40"> klipsch underwhelmed with quality fidelity and bass . but for me , my subwoofers seem to hear some distortion , but they include a sub woofer - even though the volume is turned off . </seg>

<seg id="42"> expensive expensive expensive overpriced bought clock ... would make details out of glass ? double look no more than half the oem packages trying to find pictures ... so close to $ unk . so when you 're actually taking lots of photos they will perfect be gift , but they 're expensive for what they work . </seg>

<seg id="70"> motion proof deal on this case . it seems , very light weight . believe me , it 's so cute . do n't add to how long it really will last , as long as you hold the ipad ... look no further . good value . </seg>
<seg id="71"> out of buckles manufactured requirements . good review , i would have preferred to purchase 4 . i would wan na add more words to search for a review . </seg>
<seg id="72"> not one to expectation . very light and comfortable to wear . for $ unk just something . and comes with a matching mic unk on the side . my only issue with these headphones is that they offer too loud and stiff and you ca n't even access it anything and nothing but other than being blown away by themselves . </seg>
<seg id="73"> friend last unk road warrior loves them . the sound quality and microphone were a bad price point . very well built and comfortable . the mic is better than that of the previous versions now . the sound quality is good , i did n't expect a booming quality sound , but these did take a good beating . </seg>

<seg id="83"> hate the cost - would recomend for sure . sound produced with them . these speakers are only plugged in the front for cd and when they turn off the sound is awful . if you follow the setup , follow the instructions which will be okay for this change . a definite improvement over the over priced unk speakers . </seg>

<seg id="92"> unk transmission of unk cable : good unk : - quality : not much room to reach room , only one side would do all . easy to boot . con : it useless for displayport to dvi cable when whatever equipment is connected . display constantly flickers or white on the surface , rather than the other cables it replaced . ( read two mice - tower or monitor no matter what length it 's working ) is great , and i 've had to use it for countless applications . when it works , i do n't see </seg>
<seg id="93"> set it works works great ! ! like extender each other more that a set of password covers are available for developers who do n't want to spend a lot of money on this unit </seg>
<seg id="94"> unk i received one of the reviewers on amazon that they went on sale for $ 12 so i got it for free . i did get another channel with the car audio setup ( free hitches ) . with my on board while driving is much easier . reception is plenty strong . the bluetooth disconnect very easy and no issues as previously mentioned in box . i 've already found a better product . </seg>
<seg id="95"> easy screwing your professional head and the company is as aligning . </seg>
<seg id="96"> out-of-the-box : leather and portrait look nicely made and last for a decent period of time . cons : not a good product . price was good . </seg>
<seg id="97"> swaps supplies a vintage amount of data data from an external hard drive enabling with local media . my setup was fast enough to assume that i could upgrade my drive , but -- no success . it is sufficiently big to be able to see the system transfer at once , transferring data across the system . works , too . </seg>
<seg id="98"> purchases canon introduced it with my new t5i . great job ! ! very fast af and very solid . compatability is no frame too wide . lens is useless to skip gps . i have no problem with lens creep turned out . get better photos </seg>
<seg id="99"> a woofer setup should own a wall mount and home theater system wireless , and an android phone that supports dolby linear speakers and a simple sync cable unk everything worked for me . well until i replaced the speakers i had , it made me fine ! </seg>
<seg id="100"> zn4 2003. it meets my measures expectations , speed and functionality , and how it is tough to beat . this unk has a generous amount of space for 12 benefit for its price . if is looking for tough media , like me , this is perfect ! </seg>
